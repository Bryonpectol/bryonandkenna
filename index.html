            <h1>Things I love about Kenna</h1>
            <ul class="specialdatesul">
                <li class="noneli">I love her super bubbly personality! She is one of those people that you are really lucky to meet. No matter what, she will always put a smile on your face. Being married to Kenna is like getting to meet your childhood hero every single day, and they are also your best friend. Kenna is someone that will not leave you bored no matter how long you've been together. Being with her for the last 6 years, I haven't had a single boring moment with her. Her personality is EASILY a 10/10. Perfect!</li>
                <li class="noneli">Another thing I love about Kenna is her stunning, gorgeous looks. Anyone with eyes can tell you that Kenna is absolutely beautiful. I personally know dozens of people who have had crushes on her sinces I've known her, and that's probably only half the people! She has the most perfect hair because no matter what style she does it in, it always looks freaking amazing! Whether it's straightened down, wavy, or big curls, it always looks so pretty! Her eyes are always so big and glowing. I love when her eyes are green, but Kenna has this amazing thing where her eyes turn either green or blue depending on what she is wearing that day, I especially like her blue eyes. They are so beautiful and every once in a while I will look into her eyes at the right angle and they literally stun you with how beautiful, and sparkling they are. </li>
                <li class="noneli">I could add to this list for the rest of my life, and that's exactly what I am going to do. So it will keep growing more and more.</li>
